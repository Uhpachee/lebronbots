Machine Learning Notes

- Machine learning is the idea that through inputting data and/or giving feedback to the computer, the artificial intelligence can become more accurate
- K nearest algorithm: Algorithm, where, based on the data points near the selected point, the computer will make a judgement.
- More data: better model: better accuracy
- Three ways machine learns:
- Supervised learning: The computer knows the features of the object, and the labels of the object to make an informed decision.
- unsupervised learning: learning with un labeled data
- reinforcement learning: manual feedback given back to the computer when experimentally judging an object, in which the computer will learn for future reference.


## Rohan Machine Learning Notes

- How does our brain recognize several different numbers with different patterns if they are not comprehended by a computer by pixels
- The problem is having computers have the same level of pattern recognition our neurons have
- Solution is to create a neural network where each image is split into individual elements we use to identify each number
- ex: an 8, consists of two loops, whereas a 9 consists of one loop in the top have and a strait line segment in the bottom half
- Neuron → thing that stores a number or the “Activation”
- Each layer of the network will check for a different pattern, and the correct combination of each pattern results in understanding what the number is
- The laste layer has 10 neurons which combine all the information known about the image to identify which number it is from one to nine
- Hidden layers correlate to each individual element
- Going to be the algorithm that does all the calculations and recognizes the number
- To find each individual element, the computer must take an area from the pixelated image and average the amount of uncolored pixels in the area
- Each different element, whether being a loop or a strait line, has different averages over a set area
- We can use this information to identify different elements in the overall picture, then add them up together to identify the image
- Can be inconsistent depending on how much the image differs from the uniform understanding of a number
- Neural networks can involve itself in machine learning by imitating how the human brain operates in pattern recognition, and identifying/quantifying things around us with image inputs
