# Welcome
This is the project of the trimester 3 lebronbots

Main idea: Our website is a online food ordering service that allows users to order food from local 4s ranch restaurants.

Group members: [Justin](https://github.com/jli615), [Rohan](https://github.com/RohanKoshy), [Ryan](https://github.com/ryanmgds), [Kian](https://github.com/Uhpachee)

**Title**: QuickFood

**Sponsor**: Wendy’s 

**Project Owner**: Manager Irfan Nasim and the Wendy’s restaurant chain have wanted a better personal online connection with their local customers, and by investing in their restaurant they are able to have a more personalized feedback than their official Wendy’s application.

Plan:
We’ll create a very simple site for ordering food, making it extremely easy for people to order their food. It’ll be a lot better than DoorDash since it’ll only have the priority restaurants that are the most popular. Aside from Wendy’s we’ll have a few other fast food restaurants because those are usually the most priority and the most visited.
