# Welcome
This is the project of the one and only p2-slackbots and our project is called Cooler Math Games!

Main idea: Our website is the go-to place for gamers. All kinds of stuff relating to gaming, we got it! We implement information pages for gamers (or non-gamers) to look at to learn, and we also have real games for users to play. Come to this website for real time information, games you can play directly on the website, and redirection to real games. Have fun!
The games will be pulled in from an API, as well as personally customed by us.

## PBL Theme
Our PBL project is based off a video game arcade. We wanted to create a website that was really delicious so that it could capture the essence of an arcade and make it a hub where people can play online games and learn about new games. 

Our main features include our games page which goes over multiple games and show our rankings for best and worst games. This match our PBL theme because it continues the theme of an arcade and goes over the games that we like.

We also included 2 of our favorite games ever so that people can actually play the games and not just sit in our website looking at a ranking. The 2 games that we created to make people have fun was wordle and sudoku. These match up to our pbl feature because it follows the gaming theme and the arcade theme so that people can have a fun gaming experience. 

Here is our picture of Sudoku:

## Bootstrap

We used a lot of bootstrap throughout our project, but the most important one definitely has to be in our fragments through our header and our navigation bar. We have this bootstrap in literally EVERY SINGLE HTML file, which explains how important this bootstrap really is. Here are some code snippets from the navgiation bar as well as the navigation bar on the main website.
